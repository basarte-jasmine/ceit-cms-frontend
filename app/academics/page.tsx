    overview: `Civil engineering deals with the design, construction and maintenance of physical and naturally built environments, including works such as bridges, roads, canals, dams and buildings. This field is traditionally broken into several subdisciplines, including environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering, water sources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying and construction engineering. Civil engineering takes place in all levels: in the public sector from municipal to national levels, and in the private sector from individual home owners to international companies.

The University will produce Civil Engineering graduates who will:
- Highly establish themselves in their specialized field of civil engineering and able to provide technical solutions to complex engineering problems;
- Continuously adapt to the developing needs of the profession by pursuing career improvement through studies and trainings;
- Involve themselves to the community to promote social and ethical responsibility, awareness and development.`,
